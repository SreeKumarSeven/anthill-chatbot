## Installation on Wix

There are two methods to add the chatbot to your Wix website:

### Method 1: Using HTML Embed (Recommended)

1. **Go to your Wix Editor**
2. **Add an HTML iFrame**:
   - Click the "+" button to add a new element
   - Search for "HTML iFrame" and add it to your page
   - Size the element as needed (you can make it invisible for the floating widget)

3. **Add the Widget Code**:
   - In the HTML settings panel, paste the following code:

```html
<script src="https://SreeKumarSeven.github.io/anthill-chatbot/anthill_chatbot_widget.js"></script>
<link rel="stylesheet" href="https://SreeKumarSeven.github.io/anthill-chatbot/anthill_chatbot_widget.css">
```

4. **Save and Publish** your Wix site

### Method 2: Using an Embedded iFrame

This method is useful if you want the chatbot to appear in a specific location on your page rather than as a floating widget.

1. **Go to your Wix Editor**
2. **Add an HTML iFrame**:
   - Click the "+" button to add a new element
   - Search for "HTML iFrame" and add it to your page
   - Size the element as needed

3. **Set the iFrame Source**:
   - In the iFrame settings, set the source URL to:
   ```
   https://SreeKumarSeven.github.io/anthill-chatbot/chatbot_iframe.html
   ```

4. **Save and Publish** your Wix site

## Vercel Deployment

This project has been optimized for deployment on Vercel's serverless platform. The optimization was necessary to overcome Vercel's 250MB deployment size limit.

> **Note**: This branch is specifically optimized for Vercel deployment.

Key optimizations include:
- Minimized dependencies (only using openai, python-dotenv, requests, psycopg2-binary)
- Simplified database connections using direct psycopg2 instead of SQLAlchemy
- Exclusion of unnecessary files and directories via .vercelignore
- Core functionality maintained while removing unused features

For detailed deployment instructions, see [VERCEL-DEPLOY-GUIDE.md](VERCEL-DEPLOY-GUIDE.md).
