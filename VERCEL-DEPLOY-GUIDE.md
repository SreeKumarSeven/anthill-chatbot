# Anthill IQ Chatbot Vercel Deployment Guide

This guide explains how to deploy the optimized Anthill IQ chatbot to Vercel.

## Prerequisites

- A Vercel account
- Git installed on your machine
- Railway PostgreSQL database (already set up)

## Deployment Steps

### 1. Push to GitHub

Make sure your code is pushed to a GitHub repository. Vercel will use this repository for deployment.

### 2. Import Project in Vercel

1. Log in to your Vercel account
2. Click "Add New" â†’ "Project"
3. Select your GitHub repository with the Anthill IQ chatbot code
4. Configure the project:
   - Framework Preset: `Other`
   - Root Directory: (keep as default)
   - Build Command: (leave empty)
   - Output Directory: (leave empty)

### 3. Set Environment Variables

In the Vercel project settings, add these environment variables:

```
OPENAI_API_KEY=your_openai_api_key
DATABASE_URL=postgresql://postgres:uEutQJRqyRbgOlzwhsGGgczYXaeBqgxI@yamabiko.proxy.rlwy.net:14599/railway
```

Replace with your actual values if they differ.

### 4. Deploy

Click "Deploy" and wait for the deployment to complete.

## What's Optimized

To overcome the Vercel 250MB deployment size limit, the following optimizations were made:

1. **Minimal Dependencies**: Using only essential packages:
   - openai
   - python-dotenv
   - requests
   - psycopg2-binary

2. **File Exclusions**:
   - We've configured `.vercelignore` and `vercel.json` to exclude unnecessary files
   - `api/backend_for_vercel/` and other large directories are excluded
   - Frontend assets are excluded where possible

3. **Simplified Database**: 
   - Using direct psycopg2 connections instead of SQLAlchemy
   - Minimal table structures
   - Reduced error logging

4. **Base Functionality Only**:
   - The API provides just the essential chatbot and user registration functions
   - Removed all optional features not needed for core functionality

## Troubleshooting

### Size Issues

If deployment still exceeds the 250MB limit:

1. Run `vercel --debug` locally to see what files are being included
2. Add more patterns to `.vercelignore` if needed
3. Further remove unused Python imports
4. Try using the `excludeFiles` option in `vercel.json` to exclude large files

### Database Connection Issues

If the database connection fails:

1. Verify the DATABASE_URL environment variable is correct
2. Check if Railway database is accessible from Vercel's IP range
3. Try increasing the connection timeout in `simple_db.py`

## Testing

Before deploying, you can validate the setup by running the test script:

```
python test_vercel.py
```

All modules should import successfully.
